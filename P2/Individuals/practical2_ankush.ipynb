    "Before implementing NBC, we suggest you first implement the three types of the distributions of the parameters of NBC. Your implementation should have two functions: **estimate** and **get_probability**. The estimate function takes some data as input and computes the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for the parameters $\\theta$ of the distribution $p(x | \\theta)$. The get_probability function takes a new input value $x_{new}$ and returns $p(x_{new} | \\theta)$. For example, in the case of continuous features, we can use the Gaussian distribution. The estimate function will find the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ for the Gaussian distribution with respect to the input data, and the function get_probability will return $\\mathcal{N}(x_{new} \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)$. \n",
